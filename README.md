# heart-disease-analysis
A data analysis project using Python to explore and visualize heart disease data. Includes EDA, feature insights, and correlation patterns using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

#  Heart Disease Data Analysis

This project performs an analysis on a heart disease dataset using Python. The goal is to understand the relationship between various health features and heart disease presence using data visualization and exploration techniques.

---

##  Objectives

- Clean the dataset (handle duplicates and nulls)
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize relationships between features and target variable
- Understand patterns related to heart disease

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

##  Dataset

- UCI Heart Disease Dataset  
- Features: age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.  
- Target: 1 (disease), 0 (no disease)

---

##  Visualizations

- Correlation heatmap
- Distribution of age, sex, and chest pain
- Heart disease distribution by gender and chest pain type
- Blood pressure and cholesterol visualizations
